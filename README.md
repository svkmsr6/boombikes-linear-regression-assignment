# BoomBikes demand modelling using Linear regression
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
This project is about modelling the demand for rides in BoomBikes using a Linear Regression Model

- What is the background of your project?
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
    1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?
    2. How well those variables describe the bike demands?

- What is the dataset that is being used?
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. This is present as day.csv in the repository

## Conclusions
- The demand for booking is likely to increase with temperature, the year of booking and with the onset of the Winter season
- The demand is likely to decrease with windspeed, the onset of Spring season, weather conditions such as Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds, Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist, during the months of July, November and December and also during Sundays
